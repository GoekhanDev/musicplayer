## Usage

### General Stuff
Songs are Loaded from /User/Music's Folder and being added to the music library.</br>
Songs are downloaded with youtube dl, there will be a .exe file in the releases folder I recommend to update it.</br>

### Main Page

Mainpage gives you a selection of songs, a search option and a clear view of what song is playing.</br>
Underneath the mainpage are the controls like any other music player start, pause, forward, backward, set duration, set volume.

### Download Page

The Download page contains a search option that grabs results from Soundcloud.</br>
Every result is listed in a list and with a mouse hover and a click the selected track can be downloaded.</br>
After the download it will be added to the current music list and will be stored locally at your Musics folder with all the metadata.
